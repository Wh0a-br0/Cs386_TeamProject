CS 386 – Software Engineering
Team Project – D.1 Inception
Grading: 30 points

In this deliverable, you report the results of the software inception. Structure your deliverable using the following sections.

Introduction: describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.

	We believe that many people struggle to find the time to track how many hours of pay must be on their next paycheck. Some of us will blindly accept a paycheck without confirming we’re being paid fully. We believe we have come up with a solution to easily confirm the legitimacy of your paychecks. Money Monkey is a web app that displays how much money the user has made so far in a certain work shift. This program runs in the background, changing by the cent every second. Users are able to log their hours to keep track of hours per pay period. While in a shift, users are able to pause the clock for a break. When employees receive a paycheck, they input the start and end dates of their pay period into Money Monkey. Our program will output the amount of hours worked and the gross pay (w or w/out overtime) that should match the paycheck. 

Grading criteria (5 points): Your paragraph should be well written in formal language and must contain all the required information. Be clear, concise, and check for typos and grammar errors. 

Initial value proposition and customer segments: report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.
(i) Value proposition
Keeping track of the resources customers have 
Confirming earnings 
Saving time so they don't have to calculate
Easier calculations 
Makes you feel cool
Simple way to see how much you earn

(ii) Customer Segments
Hourly employees 
College students
Highschool students 
Retail employees
Interns 
Food industry workers 
Grading criteria (5 points): The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality. The value proposition and consumer segment should be coherent with the text in the previous section---in particular, the value should address the problem reported above (problem-solution fit). The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific. 

Interviews summary: present the results of each interview (the minimum number of interviews is 1.5 * the number of participants in the group). 
For each interview, report:
Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview
When
Customer segment
Key insights from the interview
Representative quotes
Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)







Grading criteria (15 points): You should have at least the required number of interviews. For each interview, you should report the required information. The insight should be grounded on the interview and illustrated by the representative quotes. 

Final value proposition and consumer segments: report the refined versions of these elements (the ones that you reached after the interviews).
