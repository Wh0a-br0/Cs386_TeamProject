CS 386 – Software Engineering
Team Project – D.1 Inception
Grading: 30 points

In this deliverable, you report the results of the software inception. Structure your deliverable using the following sections.

Introduction: describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.

	We believe that many people struggle to find the time to track how many hours of pay must be on their next paycheck. Some of us will blindly accept a paycheck without confirming we’re being paid fully. We believe we have come up with a solution to easily confirm the legitimacy of your paychecks. Money Monkey is a web app that displays how much money the user has made so far in a certain work shift. This program runs in the background, changing by the cent every second. Users are able to log their hours to keep track of hours per pay period. While in a shift, users are able to pause the clock for a break. When employees receive a paycheck, they input the start and end dates of their pay period into Money Monkey. Our program will output the amount of hours worked and the gross pay (w or w/out overtime) that should match the paycheck. 

Grading criteria (5 points): Your paragraph should be well written in formal language and must contain all the required information. Be clear, concise, and check for typos and grammar errors. 

Initial value proposition and customer segments: report the initial guesses for the (i) value proposition and (ii) customer segment. The value proposition should make clear what your product is, the target customer, the value you provide, and why your product is unique. See examples on the lecture slides.
(i) Value proposition
Keeping track of the resources customers have 
Confirming earnings 
Saving time so they don't have to calculate
Easier calculations 
Makes you feel cool
Simple way to see how much you earn

(ii) Customer Segments
Hourly employees 
College students
Highschool students 
Retail employees
Interns 
Food industry workers 
Grading criteria (5 points): The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality. The value proposition and consumer segment should be coherent with the text in the previous section---in particular, the value should address the problem reported above (problem-solution fit). The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific. 

Interviews summary: present the results of each interview (the minimum number of interviews is 1.5 * the number of participants in the group). 
For each interview, report:
Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview
When
Customer segment
Key insights from the interview
Representative quotes
Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care (how the interviewee sees the solution)






































8. Lauren R. (9/22/2022)- Naima
Lauren is a cashier at Dunkin Donuts. She physically clocks in on the register when she gets to work. Pay stubs are printed out when she clocks out. 
They display the start time and total hours. Lauren does not agree with how her overtime is calculated because it is carried on to the next pay roll period.
She is not concerned about her check is calculated because she can always check on a federal website, the amount of hours she worked and her pay. 
She keeps track of her hours mentally because it only requires some quick calculations to see if her pay is correct. She said “ I can usually do some quick math
and find that my paycheck is roughly correct”. If she was being shorted, she would speak with her manager to fix the issue. She mentioned that there would be no 
hostile confrontation. The assessment for this interview is Don’t care.

9. Brian W.(9/21/2022) - Naima
Brian is an associate at a grocery store. He said the time tracking system works in conjunction with the badge clock. 
It tracks the time worked when you clock in or out. He said he is not worried about how his check is tracked because ADP is used at his workplace.
His gross pay is calculated on his check along taxes. He said there is an app for ADP but he does not use it because it is just a convenience. 
It takes minimal effort to login to ADP on a search browser. He said “it literally only takes 1 minute to check when I clock in”. 
Brian also mentioned that he keeps tracks of his hours with the tracking information system that is provided. He said it only takes about 30 minutes a 
week to do calculations to make sure his hours and check are correct. At his job overtime was calculated by working over 8 hours in a shift. If he was being shorted,
he said he would speak to his manager and ask for compensation. The assessment for this interview was Don’t care.
