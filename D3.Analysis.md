## Team Project – D.3 Analysis

## **1. System Description**
The problem of finding time to accurately track all work hours affects hourly **workers**; the impact of which is the potential of shorted paychecks or unpaid hours. For young adults and college students who have trouble <ins> _keeping track_ </ins> of their gross hourly income and overtime, Money Monkey is a **payroll tracking** app that <ins>_keeps track_</ins> of any potential errors that might occur on a paycheck and ensures that the **worker** is always being paid the correct amount; unlike ADP, Money Monkey has an aesthetic UI, which makes the user feel trendy while <ins>_keeping track_</ins> of their income. Money Monkey allows hourly wage **workers** to <ins>_track_</ins> the amount of money they have made on their _shift_, to ensure that the **worker** is being paid the correct amount and to mitigate any _potential error_ with their paycheck. 

(1).Upon application startup, Money Monkey will prompt the **worker** for their _hourly wage_ .. As Money Monkey will work with _hourly wages_, the stakeholders will consist of college students or high school students working part time jobs, employers who work without a clock-in/clock-out system, and employers who could cut the wage of employees short.

(2).Money Monkey’s main display will show a simple timer. It will provide the user with a display containing a simple timer starting from 00:00:00 and a wage counter initialized to zero US dollars. Once the **worker** <ins>starts the clock</ins>, Money Monkey will keep track of both the **worker’s** _shift time_ and the _wages_ they’ve earned, as both the wage clock and the shift time increment with every second.

(3).Money Monkey interface will allow **workers** to <ins>_start, pause, stop, or reset the display’s timer_</ins> when needed in order to match their **shift** hours. Starting the display timer will <ins>count up until</ins> the **worker** <ins>_pauses or stops the timer_</ins>. <ins>_Pausing_</ins> the timer will temporarily stop the counting until they decide to <ins>_ resume_</ins> it. **Workers** will be brought to the pay period screen after <ins>_stopping_</ins> the **shift** display timer. <ins>_Resetting_</ins> the timer will reset  the display counter to 00:00:00. 


(4).Based on the hourly _wage_ provided by the **worker** on application startup, Money Monkey will calculate the worker’s corresponding earnings per second. The **worker's** will be able to enter their _wage_ per hour and <ins>_select the submit button_</ins>, so it is kept track of in the database for the final pay calculations of their **shift**. After clicking submit, the workers will be able to <ins>view</ins> the **wage clock**. 

(5). In addition to the timer on the Money Monkey display, a **shift clock** will also be shown. This **shift clock** will increment every second according to the calculated wage per second for the user. **Workers** can <ins>view</ins> the **shift clock** throughout their **shift** if needed, and watch in real time how their earnings correspond to the amount of time they’ve spent at work without having to do any calculations themselves. 

(6).Money Monkey will be available as both a web app and a mobile app to accommodate different **worker** needs. This will allow a more convenient option for **workers** to access if they do not have an available computer, or simply would prefer to have their **shift clock** on hand. The accounts will also have the same **shifts** stored in the database, so **workers** can access their tracked wage between devices.
